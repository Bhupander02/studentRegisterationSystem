## ⚙️ What Is This?

This is **Student Registration System** — a web-based application that lets you add, edit, view, and delete student records directly in the browser. All data is stored using browser local storage, so there’s *no database setup required*.  

Perfect for prototyping, demos, or small projects where you just need simple student data management (without a backend).

## ✅ Key Features

- ➕ Add new student entries (name, roll number, etc.)  
- ✏️ Edit existing student records  
- 🗑️ Delete student records  
- ✔️ Prevent duplicate entries  
- 🔄 Data persists across page reloads (thanks to local storage)  
- 📋 View a neat list/table of all registered students

## 🧰 Tech Stack

| Frontend      | Languages / Tools        |
|--------------|--------------------------|
| HTML         | Markup for pages         |
| CSS / Vanilla JS | Styling + logic         |
| Web Storage  | Browser localStorage for persistent data |

Simple, minimal, and easy to understand — an ideal starter project.

## 🚀 Quick Start (Run Locally)

```bash
# 1. Clone or download the repo
git clone https://github.com/Bhupander02/studentRegisterationSystem.git

# 2. Open index.html in your browser
cd studentRegisterationSystem
open index.html   # or double-click in file browser
```
That’s it — the app will run without any server or installation!

🎯 How to Use

Fill in the student details (name, roll number, etc.) and click “Add”.

The student gets added to the list below.

Want to modify details? Click the “Edit” button next to that student.

Want to remove? Click “Delete”.

All changes are saved to browser local storage — so data remains even if you refresh/close the tab.

🔧 Possible Enhancements (Roadmap)

💾 Add a real backend + database (Node.js / PHP / etc.) for persistent storage

🆔 Add unique student-ID / validation to avoid duplicates more reliably

🖼️ Add profile photos or avatars

🔍 Add search / filter / sort functionality

📄 Add export/import (e.g. JSON, CSV) support

💬 Add user authentication (admin vs student)

🎨 Improve UI/UX — use a UI framework (Bootstrap / Tailwind etc.)
